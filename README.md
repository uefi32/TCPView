## Introduction

TCPView is a lightweight yet highly effective network monitoring utility developed by Sysinternals for Windows users who need precise visibility into active TCP and UDP connections. Designed for system administrators, security professionals, and power users, the tool provides a clear, real-time overview of all network endpoints established by running applications. Its intuitive interface displays essential details such as local and remote addresses, connection states, process identifiers, and associated executables, allowing users to quickly identify which programs are communicating over the network.

One of TCPView’s core strengths is its ability to update connection lists dynamically, highlighting new connections in green, closed ones in red, and changed states in yellow. This visual approach simplifies tracking suspicious or unexpected network activity, making it easier to detect malware behavior, unauthorized connections, or misconfigured software. The tool also allows users to close individual connections or terminate entire processes directly from the interface, providing immediate control during troubleshooting or security assessments.

TCPView serves as a powerful alternative to the traditional `netstat` command, offering richer insights and usability without requiring command-line expertise. Whether you're diagnosing connectivity problems, analyzing application behavior, or enhancing your security posture, TCPView delivers reliable, real-time network visibility in a compact and efficient package.
